# üîê Security Configuration Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: API Key Security

Your app now uses **secure configuration management** to protect sensitive API keys from being exposed in version control.

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Google Credentials (Simplified!)

Your app now uses a **much simpler** credential setup since you're only using Google Sign-In + Calendar/Tasks API (no Firestore complexity).

**The credentials are already configured in `Info.plist`** using environment variables!

### 2. Set Environment Variables (That's It!)

For development and production, just set these 2 environment variables:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="1079954098512-aahk5s97468gvetqdoog6ccsmfkaf04c.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export GOOGLE_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID="com.googleusercontent.apps.1079954098512-aahk5s97468gvetqdoog6ccsmfkaf04c"
```

**That's all you need!** No complex plist files, no Firestore setup, no API keys.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Secure Configuration
- API keys removed from `Info.plist` (now uses variables)
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` added to `.gitignore`
- Placeholder detection in ConfigurationManager
- Environment variable support for CI/CD

### ‚úÖ What's Protected
- Google Client ID and secrets
- API keys and project identifiers  
- Storage bucket configurations
- All sensitive Firebase/Google credentials

### ‚úÖ What's Safe to Commit
- `Info.plist` (now uses `$(GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID)` variables)
- `GoogleService-Info-Template.plist` (contains only placeholders)
- All source code files
- Configuration management code

## üö® NEVER Commit These Files
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` (real credentials)
- `.env` files with secrets
- Any file containing actual API keys

## üîß Troubleshooting

### App Won't Authenticate?
1. Check that `GoogleService-Info.plist` exists and has real values
2. Verify no "YOUR_*_HERE" placeholders remain
3. Check console for configuration warnings

### Build Issues?
1. Ensure `GoogleService-Info.plist` is in the correct location
2. Clean build folder and retry
3. Check Xcode project includes the file

## üì± Team Setup

**For new team members:**
1. Get `GoogleService-Info.plist` from secure team storage (NOT git)
2. Place in `LotusPlannerV3/LotusPlannerV3/` directory  
3. Build and run - configuration will be validated automatically

**‚úÖ Your app is now secure!** API keys are no longer exposed in version control.
