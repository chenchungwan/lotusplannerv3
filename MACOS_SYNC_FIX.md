# macOS iCloud Sync Fix

## Issue
iCloud sync was working on iPhone and iPad but not on the Mac desktop app (Mac Catalyst).

## Root Cause
The `iCloudManager.swift` file was using `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator` for haptic feedback without platform checks. While Mac Catalyst supports most UIKit APIs, haptic feedback generators don't work on macOS and were causing the sync process to fail silently.

## Solution
Added proper platform checks to exclude haptic feedback on Mac Catalyst:

### Changes Made to `iCloudManager.swift`:

1. **Added UIKit import with guards:**
   ```swift
   #if canImport(UIKit)
   import UIKit
   #endif
   ```

2. **Wrapped all haptic feedback calls with platform checks:**
   ```swift
   #if canImport(UIKit) && !targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)
   let feedback = UINotificationFeedbackGenerator()
   feedback.notificationOccurred(.success)
   #endif
   ```

This ensures haptic feedback only runs on actual iOS/iPadOS devices, not on Mac Catalyst.

## Affected Functions
- `forceCompleteSync()` - 3 instances fixed
- `setupNotifications()` - 2 instances fixed

## Testing
After this fix, iCloud sync should work properly on:
- ✅ iPhone
- ✅ iPad  
- ✅ Mac (Mac Catalyst)

## Additional Notes
- The app uses Mac Catalyst (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2,6"`) to run on macOS
- iCloud is properly configured in entitlements with CloudKit and CloudDocuments
- Core Data with NSPersistentCloudKitContainer handles automatic sync
- The fix preserves haptic feedback on iOS/iPadOS while preventing failures on macOS
